### Abstract:
This research presents a method to test the endogenous spatial correlation effect when modeling the landscape sensitivity for archaeological sites. The effects of endogenous spatial correlation are inferred using a Hierarchical Bayesian model with a Conditional Auto-Regressive (CAR) component to better understand the importance of modeling spatial cultural process. In current practice, effects of endogenous spatial autocorrelation are rarely explicitly incorporated into quantitative archaeological predictive models. This is due in part to the difficulties of measuring how cultural process relate across space and time, as well as accepting the assumption that geographically near sites are implicitly more related than distant sites. Typically these difficulties are side-stepped by including aspects of cultural processes as features and ignoring endogenous spatial correlation by assuming sites are spatially independent phenomena. While there are benefits to this approach, aside from convenience, the validity of either of these assumptions has not previously been tested. The approach developed here leads to better understanding the penalty for assuming spatial independence and the development of methods to model spatial cultural process.
